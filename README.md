# 50_days_of_Coding

## Day 1
Program to find whether kth bit is set or not
## Day 2
Finding the nearest multiple of 10
## Day 3
Finding the maximum sum after array manipulation. It involves sum of array prefixing technique. [QLink](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/crush/problem)
## Day 4
Singly linked list insertion of node at various level
## Day 5
Singly linked list deletion of nodes based on position and element + deletion of the linked list
## Day 6
Length of a linked list + Checking whether a eleent is present in the list or not
## Day 7
**Dynamic Programming (DP)**
DP comes into the picture when the problem can be sub divided into prolems of siimilar category. It involves
- Memoization (Top Down)
Before finding the value for the node, look up into the table for values. If exist use it else compte it and add in the table
- Tabulation (Bottom Up)
Calculate the all possible values from beginning to the end. (No seperate table needed, since it itself a array of values) And it doesnt have any repeated calculation.
These techniques will improve the calculation time to a great extent Eg. [40th Fib Number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overlapping-subproblems-property-in-dynamic-programming-dp-1/)
To be a DP problem, it should have
- Overlapping Subproblems
- Optimal Substructure
